Notes: Spent a lot of time on focussing on UX
1. When a user scrolls up the search bar and the tabs hide away. They dont happen immediately but rather when I know that the user is in browsing mode and does not need the search bar. 
2. User clicks on the full poster image, he/she gets to see uninterrupted full screen view of the poster.
